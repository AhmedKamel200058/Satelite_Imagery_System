# Tree Detection Using Satellite Imagery

## Project Overview
Forests are vital for ecological balance, but deforestation, climate change, and urbanization have increased the need for efficient monitoring methods. This project leverages satellite imagery and artificial intelligence to detect and monitor trees, providing an accurate, scalable, and efficient alternative to traditional methods.

---

## Objectives
- Detect and monitor trees using satellite imagery and AI.
- Efficiently assess tree cover and forest density.
- Provide real-time data visualization and monitoring via a web application.

---

## Key Features
### Web Application:
- **Realtime Data Monitoring**: Access live data on forest coverage.
- **Dashboard Interface**: User-friendly dashboards for analysis.
- **Map Integration**: Navigation and visualization of geographical data.
- **Data Visualization**: Comprehensive visual insights from satellite imagery.

### AI Model:
- Utilizes advanced deep learning algorithms to process satellite imagery(YOLOV8).
- Provides accurate outputs of tree cover and density.

## Tools & Technologies
### Frontend:
- Web technologies for an intuitive user interface (HTML , CSS).

### Backend:
- **Flask Framework**:  
  - Lightweight and modular for flexibility.
  - Built-in support for RESTful APIs.
  - Template integration with Jinja2 for dynamic HTML rendering.
